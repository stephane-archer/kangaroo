Kangaroo try to make the process of creating a GUI for your command line tool easy
if your program take a file path as argument then you are at the right place.
just build the project with `go build .` then edit the config.ini and put your command line tool next to the binary created and you are good to go!
I hope this project will save you time and that we can all make it better for each other.
Happy coding!
